# Demo Guide (Run of Show)

## AI Solution Accelerator — 10 Minute Demo

This guide is the presenter script for the demo described in [demo_proposal.md](./demo_proposal.md). It assumes the environment is already configured per [setup_guide.md](./setup_guide.md): equipment documents split across **SharePoint** (Word) and **Azure AI Search** (PDF) and connected to a **Copilot Studio** agent, and the **Work Order & Warranty System** ([../workorder-system](../workorder-system)) already deployed to Azure App Service.

---

## Pre-demo checklist

- [ ] Copilot Studio agent (**Contoso Maintenance Assistant**) is published and responding.
- [ ] SharePoint knowledge source returns results (Word documents indexed).
- [ ] Azure AI Search index (`equipment-index`) indexer status is **Success** (PDF documents indexed).
- [ ] **Work Order & Warranty System is deployed** and the dashboard (`webAppUrl`) loads; `GET {apiBaseUrl}/health` returns `ok`.
- [ ] Web search is disabled on the agent so answers come from the documents.
- [ ] VS Code open with the repo and GitHub Copilot enabled (for the "extend with code" step).
- [ ] Azure subscription signed in for deploying the Azure Function.
- [ ] Work order dashboard open in a browser tab to show live updates.
- [ ] **Copilot Cowork plugin (Contoso Equipment Insights) installed and enabled** (for the deck-generation finale). See [setup_guide.md](./setup_guide.md) Part E.
- [ ] Test pane pre-loaded with one warm-up question.

## Run of show

### 1. Business challenge (1 min)
Set the scene: a maintenance manager at Contoso Electronics needs an assistant that can both **answer equipment questions** and **take action** (warranty checks, work orders).

### 2. Build the agent — knowledge Q&A (2 min)
- Open the agent in Copilot Studio; show the two connected knowledge sources.
- Ask a question answered by **SharePoint** (Word docs) and one answered by **Azure AI Search** (PDF docs) to prove both are working.

### 3. Extend the agent with code (3 min)
- Switch to VS Code (this repo is open); use GitHub Copilot to generate **two Azure Functions** that call the already-deployed Work Order & Warranty System: `checkWarranty` (→ `GET /equipment/{assetId}/warranty`) and `createWorkOrder` (→ `POST /workorders`).
- Deploy the Function App to Azure.
- **Use the exact prompts and commands in [Building, deploying & connecting the Azure Functions](#building-deploying--connecting-the-azure-functions) below.**

### 4. Connect the new capability (2 min)
- Add the two functions as **tools/actions** in Copilot Studio (see the same section below).
- Show the agent picking them up immediately.

### 5. End-to-end experience (2 min)
- Ask a question that needs **both** knowledge and the new action (e.g., look up an equipment issue and create a work order).
- The agent reasons over the documents, calls the function (which writes to the deployed system), and returns an actionable answer.
- Switch to the **work order dashboard** to show the new work order appear live.

### 6. (Optional finale) Generate a deck with Copilot Cowork (1 min)
- Switch to **Copilot Cowork** and prompt it to build an equipment status PowerPoint.
- The **Contoso Equipment Insights** plugin pulls live data from the same system and produces a deck — see [Generating a PowerPoint with Copilot Cowork](#generating-a-powerpoint-with-copilot-cowork).

## Building, deploying & connecting the Azure Functions

This is the detailed script for demo steps 3 and 4. It creates **two HTTP-triggered Azure Functions** that act as the bridge between the Copilot Studio agent and the deployed Work Order & Warranty System:

| Function | Method | Calls the system | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------------|---------|
| `checkWarranty` | GET | `GET {WORKORDER_API_BASE}/equipment/{assetId}/warranty` | Check an asset's warranty status. |
| `createWorkOrder` | POST | `POST {WORKORDER_API_BASE}/workorders` | Create a work order for an asset. |

**Prerequisites for this step**
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) (`func`) and Azure CLI (`az`) installed.
- The **`apiBaseUrl`** from Part C of [setup_guide.md](./setup_guide.md) (e.g. `https://app-contosowo-xxxx.azurewebsites.net/api`).

### Step A — Generate the functions with GitHub Copilot

With this repo open, open Copilot Chat (agent mode) and use these prompts one at a time.

**Prompt 1 — scaffold the project and the warranty function**

> Create a new Azure Functions app in a new folder named `functions` at the repository root, using **Node.js** and the **v4 programming model** (JavaScript). Add an HTTP-triggered function named `checkWarranty` with `authLevel: 'function'` that accepts a **GET** request with an `assetId` query parameter. It should call `` `${process.env.WORKORDER_API_BASE}/equipment/${assetId}/warranty` `` using `fetch`, and return the JSON response and the same status code. If `assetId` is missing, return HTTP 400. Read the base URL from the `WORKORDER_API_BASE` environment variable.

**Prompt 2 — add the create-work-order function**

> In the same `functions` app, add an HTTP-triggered function named `createWorkOrder` with `authLevel: 'function'` that accepts a **POST** request with a JSON body containing `assetId`, `title`, `priority`, `description`, and `requestedBy`. It should POST that body to `` `${process.env.WORKORDER_API_BASE}/workorders` `` with `Content-Type: application/json`, and return the created work order JSON with the upstream status code. Validate that `assetId` and `title` are present, returning HTTP 400 otherwise.

**Prompt 3 — local settings and an OpenAPI definition**

> Add a `local.settings.json` with `WORKORDER_API_BASE` for local testing (do not commit secrets). Then generate an **OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)** file named `functions/openapi.json` describing both endpoints (`GET /api/checkWarranty` and `POST /api/createWorkOrder`), including parameters and example responses, so it can be imported as a custom connector in Copilot Studio.

> Tip: Verify locally before deploying \u2014 run `func start` in the `functions` folder and call `http://localhost:7071/api/checkWarranty?assetId=CE-OSC-1200`.

### Step B — Deploy the Function App to Azure

Run from the repo root (reuses the resource group from Part C):

```powershell
# Variables
$rg      = "rg-contoso-workorders"
$loc     = "eastus"
$storage = "stcontosofunc$(Get-Random -Maximum 99999)"
$funcApp = "func-contoso-maint-$(Get-Random -Maximum 99999)"
$apiBase = "<apiBaseUrl-from-Part-C>"   # e.g. https://app-contosowo-xxxx.azurewebsites.net/api

# Storage account (required by Azure Functions)
az storage account create -n $storage -g $rg -l $loc --sku Standard_LRS

# Function App (Linux, Consumption, Node 20, Functions v4)
az functionapp create -g $rg -n $funcApp `
  --storage-account $storage `
  --consumption-plan-location $loc `
  --runtime node --runtime-version 20 --functions-version 4 --os-type Linux

# Point the functions at the deployed Work Order & Warranty System
az functionapp config appsettings set -g $rg -n $funcApp `
  --settings WORKORDER_API_BASE=$apiBase

# Publish the function code (from the functions folder)
cd functions
func azure functionapp publish $funcApp
```

Get the invoke URLs and function keys (needed for Copilot Studio):

```powershell
# Function key for each function
az functionapp function keys list -g $rg -n $funcApp --function-name checkWarranty
az functionapp function keys list -g $rg -n $funcApp --function-name createWorkOrder
```

The invoke URL pattern is:
`https://<funcApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/checkWarranty?code=<functionKey>`

Smoke-test the deployed function:

```powershell
curl "https://$funcApp.azurewebsites.net/api/checkWarranty?assetId=CE-OSC-1200&code=<functionKey>"
```

### Step C — Add the functions as tools in Copilot Studio

**Recommended: import the OpenAPI file as a custom connector**

1. In [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com), open your **Contoso Maintenance Assistant** agent.
2. Go to **Tools** (or **Actions**) → **Add a tool** → **New tool** → **Custom connector**. This opens Power Apps custom connectors.
3. Choose **New custom connector** → **Import an OpenAPI file** and upload `functions/openapi.json`.
4. On **General**, set **Host** to `<funcApp>.azurewebsites.net` and **Base URL** to `/api`.
5. On **Security**, choose **API Key**, parameter name `code`, location **Query** (this carries the Azure Function key).
6. On **Definition**, confirm the two operations (`checkWarranty`, `createWorkOrder`) and their parameters; give each a clear **Summary/Description**.
7. **Create connector**, then **Test** it with a function key.
8. Back in Copilot Studio, on the agent select **Add a tool**, pick your custom connector, and add both operations.

**Alternative: add each function as a REST API / HTTP action**

1. On the agent, **Add a tool** → **REST API** (or **Add an action** → **Create new**).
2. Provide the method and URL, e.g. `GET https://<funcApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/checkWarranty`.
3. Add the function key as a query parameter `code` or header `x-functions-key`.
4. Define inputs (`assetId` for warranty; `assetId`, `title`, `priority`, `description`, `requestedBy` for work orders) and the JSON output.
5. Repeat for `createWorkOrder` (POST with a JSON body).

**For either approach — make the agent invoke the tools reliably**

- Give each tool a clear **description**, e.g.:
  - `checkWarranty`: "Checks the warranty status of a piece of equipment by its asset ID (e.g., CE-OSC-1200). Returns whether it is under warranty and days remaining."
  - `createWorkOrder`: "Creates a maintenance work order for a piece of equipment. Requires the asset ID and a short title; accepts priority and description."
- Describe each **input parameter** so the orchestrator maps user intent to arguments.
- **Save** and **Publish** the agent.

### Step D — Verify end to end

In the **Test** pane, run the Section D questions below (e.g., "Is CE-OSC-1200 under warranty?" and "Create a work order for the laser cutter"). Confirm the agent calls the functions and that new work orders appear on the dashboard.

## Generating a PowerPoint with Copilot Cowork

This is the optional finale (run-of-show step 6). It shows the **same** Work Order & Warranty System data being turned into a polished artifact by **Copilot Cowork** using the **Contoso Equipment Insights** plugin ([../cowork-plugin](../cowork-plugin)).

**Prerequisite:** the plugin is installed and enabled per [setup_guide.md](./setup_guide.md) Part E, and its connector points at your deployed system's `/mcp` endpoint.

### Steps

1. Open **Copilot Cowork**.
2. Go to **Sources & Skills → Plugins** and confirm **Contoso Equipment Insights** is enabled.
3. Enter one of the prompts below. Cowork triggers the `generate-equipment-deck` skill, calls the connector tools (`get_summary`, `list_equipment`, `list_work_orders`, ...) to pull **live** data, and builds the deck.
4. Show the generated PowerPoint \u2014 point out that the asset IDs, warranty statuses, and work orders match the dashboard and the agent's answers (single source of truth).

### Prompts to use

| Prompt | Result |
|--------|--------|
| "Create a PowerPoint deck summarizing our equipment warranty status and open work orders." | Full-fleet status deck (title, executive summary, inventory, warranty, attention-needed, work orders, recommendations). |
| "Generate an equipment status presentation and highlight anything out of warranty." | Deck emphasizing expired/expiring assets (e.g., CE-LAS-3300, CE-WAV-2600, CE-SOL-0450). |
| "Build a slide deck of all open and critical work orders by equipment." | Work-order-focused deck grouped by priority. |
| "Make a warranty summary deck for our test & measurement equipment." | Category-scoped deck (oscilloscope, function generator, multimeter, power supply). |

### Presenter tips

- Keep the **work order dashboard** visible alongside the generated deck so the audience sees the data match.
- If you created a new work order during step 5, ask Cowork to regenerate the deck to show it now includes that work order \u2014 reinforcing "one system, many surfaces".
- If the deck lacks real data, verify the plugin connector `mcpServerUrl` and that the system's `/mcp` endpoint is reachable.

| What maintenance is due monthly across our SMT line equipment? | Aggregates stencil printer, AOI (SharePoint) + pick-and-place (Azure AI Search). |

### D. Action questions (backed by the deployed Work Order & Warranty System)

Use these after the Azure Function tool is connected. The agent's Function calls the deployed system, so warranty answers and work orders are **real** and visible on the dashboard.

> Given the current date, some assets are intentionally **out of warranty** — great for showing the "expired → create work order" flow: CO2 Laser Cutter (CE-LAS-3300), Wave Soldering Machine (CE-WAV-2600), and Soldering Station (CE-SOL-0450). Assets like the Oscilloscope (CE-OSC-1200) and X-Ray System (CE-XRI-3400) are still **under warranty**.

| Question | Capability demonstrated |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Is the digital oscilloscope (CE-OSC-1200) still under warranty? | Warranty check — returns **Active** with days remaining. |
| Is the CO2 laser cutter (CE-LAS-3300) under warranty? | Warranty check — returns **Expired**. |
| The laser cutter (CE-LAS-3300) needs service — create a work order. | Work order creation; appears on the dashboard. |
| The soldering station keeps throwing error E-04. Look up the fix and open a maintenance work order for it. | End-to-end: knowledge retrieval + work order creation. |
| Check the warranty on the wave soldering machine (CE-WAV-2600) and, if expired, create a work order to renew the service contract. | Reasoning + conditional action against the live system. |
| Show me the open work orders for the laser cutter. | Work order lookup (`GET /workorders?assetId=CE-LAS-3300`). |

## Presenter tips

- Start with one **SharePoint** and one **Azure AI Search** question back-to-back to prove both sources work.
- Keep questions specific (include the equipment name or asset ID) for the cleanest, grounded answers.
- If an answer looks generic, confirm web search is disabled and the knowledge sources are healthy.
- Keep the **work order dashboard** visible so the audience sees work orders appear live when the agent creates them.
- Save the **action questions** for the finale so the payoff (knowledge + custom capability) lands last.
