# Demo Setup Guide

## AI Solution Accelerator — Equipment Knowledge Agent

This guide walks through setting up the full demo environment:

1. **Knowledge** — equipment documents hosted across **two** enterprise sources:
   - **Part of the documents on SharePoint** (the Word documents)
   - **Part of the documents on Azure AI Search** (the PDF documents, indexed from Azure Blob Storage)
2. **Business system** — the **Work Order & Warranty System** ([../workorder-system](../workorder-system)) deployed to **Azure App Service**. It is the source of truth for warranty status and work orders that the agent's Azure Function will call.
3. **Agent** — a **Microsoft Copilot Studio** agent that connects to the knowledge sources (and later, the deployed system via an Azure Function).
4. **Artifact generation** — a **Copilot Cowork plugin** ([../cowork-plugin](../cowork-plugin)) that generates PowerPoint decks/reports from live Work Order & Warranty System data.

Using two knowledge sources demonstrates that the agent can reason over knowledge no matter where it lives, and the deployed system shows the agent taking real business actions.

> The equipment documents are generated in [../artifacts](../artifacts). See [generate_equipment_docs.py](../artifacts/generate_equipment_docs.py) to regenerate or change the format mix.
> Deploy the Work Order & Warranty System **before** the demo (Part C below), then build/install the Cowork plugin (Part E).

## 2. Part A — Host the Word documents on SharePoint

1. Go to the [SharePoint start page](https://www.office.com/launch/sharepoint) and select **Create site** → **Team site**.
2. Name it, for example, **Contoso Electronics — Maintenance Knowledge** and finish creation.
3. In the site, open the default **Documents** library (or create a new library named `Equipment Docs`).
4. Create a folder such as `Equipment Manuals` (optional) and **Upload** the 7 Word documents listed above from the `artifacts` folder.
5. Wait a few minutes for SharePoint search to crawl and index the new files.
6. Copy and save the **site URL** (for example, `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/EquipmentKnowledge`). You will need it in Copilot Studio.

> Tip: Confirm the documents are searchable by using the SharePoint search box to look for a term such as "soldering station" before continuing.

---

## 3. Part B — Host the PDF documents on Azure AI Search

### 3.1 Create the storage account and upload PDFs

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a **Storage account** (Standard, LRS is fine) in your resource group.
2. Under **Data storage → Containers**, create a container named `equipment-docs` (private access).
3. Upload the 8 PDF documents listed above (portal upload or Azure Storage Explorer).

### 3.2 Create the Azure AI Search service

1. Create an **Azure AI Search** resource (Basic tier or higher) in the same region as the storage account.
2. Once deployed, open the service and note the **URL** and, from **Keys**, an **admin key** (used only during setup).

### 3.3 Build the index with "Import and vectorize data"

1. In the search service, choose **Import and vectorize data** (or **Import data** for a classic keyword index).
2. **Data source**: select **Azure Blob Storage** → your storage account → the `equipment-docs` container.
3. **Vectorization (optional but recommended)**: connect an **Azure OpenAI** embedding model (for example, `text-embedding-3-large`) to enable semantic/vector retrieval.
4. **Index name**: `equipment-index`.
5. Enable **Semantic ranking** if available for richer answers.
6. Run the wizard to create the **data source**, **skillset** (chunking + embeddings), **index**, and **indexer**.
7. Under **Indexers**, confirm the indexer status is **Success** and documents were indexed.

### 3.4 Verify

- Use **Search explorer** in the portal and query a term such as `oscilloscope bandwidth` to confirm results are returned.

## 4. Part C — Deploy and test the Work Order & Warranty System

The [../workorder-system](../workorder-system) app tracks work orders and is the **source of truth for warranty**. Deploy it **before** the demo so the agent's Azure Function has a live API to call. Full details are in [../workorder-system/README.md](../workorder-system/README.md).

### 4.1 Provision infrastructure (Bicep)

From the repository root:

```powershell
# Sign in and select the subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"

# Create a resource group
az group create -n rg-contoso-workorders -l eastus

# Deploy App Service + Application Insights
az deployment group create `
  -g rg-contoso-workorders `
  -f workorder-system/infra/main.bicep `
  -p workorder-system/infra/main.parameters.json
```

Record the deployment outputs: **`webAppName`**, **`webAppUrl`**, and **`apiBaseUrl`**.

### 4.2 Publish the application code

From the `workorder-system` folder:

```powershell
cd workorder-system
az webapp up `
  --name <webAppName-from-output> `
  --resource-group rg-contoso-workorders `
  --runtime "NODE:20-lts"
```

`SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true` (set by Bicep) runs `npm install` on the server during deployment.

### 4.3 Test the system

1. Open **`webAppUrl`** in a browser to view the dashboard (equipment, warranty status, and work orders).
2. Test the **warranty** endpoint (source of truth for the agent):

   ```powershell
   curl "<apiBaseUrl>/equipment/CE-OSC-1200/warranty"
   ```

   Expect JSON with `"underWarranty": true` and a `daysRemaining` value.
3. Create a **work order** and confirm it appears on the dashboard:

   ```powershell
   curl -Method POST "<apiBaseUrl>/workorders" `
     -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
     -Body '{ "assetId": "CE-LAS-3300", "title": "Test work order", "priority": "High", "requestedBy": "Setup Test" }'
   ```
4. List work orders to verify persistence: `curl "<apiBaseUrl>/workorders"`.

> Keep the **`apiBaseUrl`** handy \u2014 the Azure Function created during the demo will call `.../equipment/{assetId}/warranty` and `.../workorders`.

---

## 5. Part D — Create and connect the Copilot Studio agent

### 5.1 Create the agent

1. Go to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select your environment.
2. Create a new **Agent** (start from a description or blank). Suggested name: **Contoso Maintenance Assistant**.
3. Add agent **Instructions**, for example:

   > "You are the Contoso Electronics maintenance assistant. Answer questions about factory equipment using the connected knowledge sources. Provide specifications, maintenance schedules, safety guidance, warranty details, and troubleshooting steps. When asked about warranty status or to create/check a work order, use the connected work order action. Cite the equipment name and asset ID when relevant. If information is not available, say so."

### 5.2 Add SharePoint as a knowledge source

1. On the agent, open **Knowledge → Add knowledge**.
2. Choose **SharePoint**.
3. Paste the **SharePoint site URL** (or specific document library URL) from Part A.
4. Save. The agent will use Microsoft Search/Graph to retrieve from these documents.

### 5.3 Add Azure AI Search as a knowledge source

1. Open **Knowledge → Add knowledge** again.
2. Choose **Azure AI Search** (Advanced/enterprise knowledge source).
3. Provide:
   - **Search service endpoint** (URL from step 3.2)
   - **Index name**: `equipment-index`
   - **Authentication**: API key (paste the admin/query key) or managed identity
   - The **content**, **title**, and **vector** fields as prompted by the connector.
4. Save.

> If your environment does not expose Azure AI Search as a native knowledge source, add it as a **custom connector / tool** or via a **Power Platform connector**, pointing to the same index.

### 5.4 Configure and test

1. Set **Generative answers** to use the connected knowledge sources; ensure **web search** is disabled (or restricted) so answers come from your documents.
2. In the **Test** pane, ask a mix of questions that hit both sources (see [demo_guide.md](./demo_guide.md)).
3. Confirm answers cite equipment content and that both SharePoint and Azure AI Search sources return results.

### 5.5 Publish

1. Select **Publish** to make the agent available.
2. Optionally add channels (Teams, custom website) as needed for the demo.

## 6. Part E — Build and install the Copilot Cowork plugin

The [../cowork-plugin](../cowork-plugin) package lets **Copilot Cowork** generate PowerPoint decks/reports from live Work Order & Warranty System data. It connects to the system's `/mcp` endpoint (deployed in Part C). Full details are in [../cowork-plugin/README.md](../cowork-plugin/README.md).

### 6.1 Point the connector at your deployed system

Edit [../cowork-plugin/manifest.json](../cowork-plugin/manifest.json) and replace the `mcpServerUrl` placeholder with your deployed system's MCP endpoint (the `webAppUrl` from Part C + `/mcp`):

```json
"mcpServerUrl": "https://<your-workorder-app>.azurewebsites.net/mcp"
```

### 6.2 Package the plugin

From the `cowork-plugin` folder (all files must be at the zip **root**):

```powershell
cd cowork-plugin
Compress-Archive -Path manifest.json, color.png, outline.png, skills -DestinationPath contoso-equipment-insights.zip -Force
```

### 6.3 Install (sideload) with the Agents Toolkit CLI

```powershell
npm install -g @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli
atk --version
atk auth login
atk install --file-path "./contoso-equipment-insights.zip" --scope Personal
```

A successful install returns a `TitleId` and `AppId` \u2014 save them for updates/uninstall.

> For a tenant-wide rollout instead: **M365 admin center → Manage apps → Upload custom app**, then it appears under **Cowork → Sources & Skills → Plugins → Discover**.

### 6.4 Enable and test

1. Open **Copilot Cowork → Sources & Skills → Plugins** and enable **Contoso Equipment Insights**.
2. Prompt: *"Create a PowerPoint deck summarizing our equipment warranty status and open work orders."*
3. Confirm the deck is generated with real asset IDs and warranty data (proves the MCP connector is reachable).

> If Cowork can't reach the connector, verify the deployed system's `/mcp` endpoint responds and that the `mcpServerUrl` in the manifest is correct.

---

## 7. Prepare for the "Extend with code" step

During the demo you build an **Azure Function** that calls the Work Order & Warranty System deployed in Part C, then add it as a tool in Copilot Studio. To be ready:

- Have the **`apiBaseUrl`** from Part C available. The Function will call:
  - `GET  {apiBaseUrl}/equipment/{assetId}/warranty` \u2014 check warranty.
  - `POST {apiBaseUrl}/workorders` \u2014 create a work order.
  - `GET  {apiBaseUrl}/workorders?assetId={assetId}` \u2014 look up existing work orders.
- Ensure you have the **Azure Functions** extension in VS Code and are signed in to Azure.
- Note the **asset IDs** (e.g., `CE-OSC-1200`, `CE-LAS-3300`) used in demo questions.

See [demo_guide.md](./demo_guide.md) for the full run-of-show and sample questions.

---

## 8. Teardown

After the demo, to avoid charges:

- Delete the resource group holding the Work Order & Warranty System (`rg-contoso-workorders`) and the Azure Function.
- Delete the Azure AI Search service and storage account (or their resource group).
- Uninstall the Cowork plugin: `atk uninstall --title-id <TitleId>` (or remove it from the M365 admin center), using the `TitleId` saved during install.
- Optionally remove the SharePoint library and unpublish the Copilot Studio agent.
